# vite-vue-trpc-prisma-express

TRPC does not have a package for vue. This template is my attempt at starting one with similar functionality to TRPCs React package.


This repo utilizes:

[TRPC](https://trpc.io/)

[Vitesse Lite](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-lite)

[vue-query](https://vue-query-next.vercel.app/#/)

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)


The TRPC setup is largely based on this [awesome tutorial by TomDoesTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syEWlxVFUrY)


WIP: replicate the functions in **createReactQueryHooks** from the [TRPC react package](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/main/packages/react/src/createReactQueryHooks.tsx)
